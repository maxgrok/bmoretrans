A coalition of Trans led and Trans inclusive organizations in Baltimore City working towards the upward mobility and empowerment of Transgender residents through advocacy and education.

## Mission

"Unify, Reclaim, Empower"
The Baltimore Transgender Alliance works to uplift the voices of transgender and gender non-conforming people in Baltimore City and continually center our communityâ€™s needs in broader political conversations. In July of 2015, we held the Baltimore Trans Uprising protest to highlight the systemic injustices that leave trans women of color vulnerable to violence and harassment. In November of 2015, we participated in a national Trans March of Resilience to both honor the trans people who have died and demonstrate the strength and solidarity of community and our movement. We are parents, artists, business owners, students, and citizens representing ourselves in public and refusing to back down.
